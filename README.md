## Setup
You'll want to run ```script/bootstrap``` from time to time to update the GeoLiteCity database from [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home), although we have packaged a version with this.

## Purpose
__Utilitybelt__ provides common functions needed when writing security tools.

- Reverse DNS
- Geolocation
- IP Range Calculators (Long, Between, is_RFC1918, etc)
- Common Regular Expressions

We aim to provide more and welcome [contributions](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Use

You can get utilitybelt like a sane human being using pip:

```
$ pip install utilitybelt
```

From there add a simple:
`
```python
import utilitybelt as ub

ub.is_reserved("1.1.1.1")
```

And away you go!

## Development

You want to add some features? Awesome! First off, take a look at the [contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Setup
You'll want to run ```script/bootstrap``` from time to time to update the GeoLiteCity database from [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home), although we have packaged a version with this. In Linux (Ubuntu), you may need to install ```libgeoip-dev```.

### Tests
Super simple. After you've run ```pip install```, just use ```script/test``` to run the test suite.
